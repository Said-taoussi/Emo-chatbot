# Multilingual Voice Assistant

This is a voice assistant that supports English and French, using various libraries like TensorFlow, NLTK, and Speech Recognition. It uses a trained machine learning model for response prediction, and leverages OpenAI's GPT-3 for generating responses when the input doesn't match known patterns. The assistant also includes a simple GUI built using Kivy.
